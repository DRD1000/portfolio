A reddit scraper was made to collect to collect the data of hot/rising/top/new posts from a given subreddit. This tool was made to provide the content creation team with a more efficient, convenient way of determining what's trending while giving insight into why those topics are trending. The tool was connected to a discord bot for a non-techinical user friendly interface and allows a variety of results including posts and their comments (by most upvotes or most replies), word clouds and token frequency charts, or a csv file of the resulting dataframe. Users were able to disclose the number of posts they wanted to retrieve or well as from which subreddit and post category.
